# Contributing to Google Summer of Code

While everyone is welcome to contribute to [PRoot](https://github.com/proot-me/proot/blob/master/HACKING.rst),
the purpose of this repository is specifically for students in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program.

## Projects

Take a look at the [`ideas/`](https://github.com/proot-me/gsoc/tree/master/ideas) directory, for a list of project ideas that can be worked on, and find one that you like. Then take a look at the GSoC Student Guide on [writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal). If you have your own idea, [create an issue](https://github.com/proot-me/gsoc/issues/new?assignees=&labels=idea&template=project-idea.md&title=) for it to be added here.

## Communication

All communications should take place on either [Gitter](https://gitter.im/proot-me/gsoc), or on a thread in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/proot-me/gsoc/issues). Students must be reachable throughout the day, and must be available for a weekly meeting with their mentor.

## Expectations

Students are expected to work around thirty hours a week on their project. At the end of each day/week, the student must deliver a report highlighting their progress, roadblocks, and plans for the next day/week. Reports must be submitted in blog format as a PR to the [PRoot Development Blog](https://github.com/proot-me/blog).
